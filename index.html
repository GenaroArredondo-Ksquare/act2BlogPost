            The hacienda was established in 1774 and the Sauteña in 1888, being its main partner Don Iñigo Noriega, became an important economic trigger: <br>
            Roads were built that started from El Soldadito (today Matamoros) that linked Colombres -as it was previously called Río Bravo- with the United States and the Capital. <br>
            In 1882, the railway called El Nacional was inaugurated, linking Estación Cuevas (today Ciudad Díaz Ordaz) with Matamoros, passing through Estación Ébano, now Río Bravo.

        <article style="text-align: center;">The commercial and agricultural empire that La Sauteña represented reached its peak on May 10, 1913, when General Lucio Blanco took the City of Reynosa and later Colombres. <br>
            The revolutionaries destroyed everything in their path, destroying the entire city and, incidentally, the dreams of its inhabitants who had managed to convert <br>
             the city in the center of tourist, commercial and industrial attraction, most important in the North zone, including the South region of the United States.</article>

    <article style="text-align: center;">
        The most popular food in Rio Bravo are Tacos Jalisco, there isn't one every two or three streets that doesn't have a Tacos food truck or establishment. <br>
        Even cities or counties nearby come to Rio Bravo due to people travelling to the USA, and they often stop in one of the most popular establishments to have an order of Tacos; <br>
        They even order to go to freeze them and take them on coolers, so they can share with their families or friends in USA, i can vouch that even when they're frozen, <br>
        just reheating them will make them feel like they're fresh out of the counter.
